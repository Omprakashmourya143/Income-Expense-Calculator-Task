Introduction :-
In this article, we will delve into a JavaScript code snippet that implements a simple expense tracker. This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter their financial entries, while also calculating total income, total expenses, and net balance. The use of local storage ensures that the data persists even after the page is refreshed.

Key Concepts :-

Local Storage: This is used to store the entries persistently in the user's browser.
Event Listeners: These are employed to handle user interactions, such as adding entries and filtering them.
DOM Manipulation: The code dynamically updates the HTML to reflect the current state of the entries and totals.
Array Methods: Functions like filter, reduce, and forEach are utilized to process the entries efficiently.

Code Structure :-

addEntry: Adds a new financial entry to the list.
displayEntries: Displays the entries based on the selected filter.
calculateTotals: Computes total income, total expenses, and net balance.
deleteEntry: Removes an entry from the list.
editEntry: Allows users to edit an existing entry.
filterEntries: Updates the displayed entries based on the selected filter.

Conclusion :-
This JavaScript code snippet provides a robust foundation for a simple expense tracker application. By utilizing local storage, event listeners, and DOM manipulation, it effectively allows users to manage their financial entries. The modular structure of the code enhances readability and maintainability, making it an excellent starting point for further enhancements or integrations. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding this code can significantly enhance your JavaScript skills and your ability to create interactive web applications.
